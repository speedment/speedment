     * Creates a lazily concatenated Stream whose elements are are all the
     * elements of the streams in sequential order. The resulting Stream is
     * ordered if all of the input streams are ordered, and parallel if at least
     * one of the input streams are parallel. When a terminating operation is
     * called, all the streams are automatically and explicitly closed, whereby
     * their close handlers are invoked. AutoClosing is performed in sequential
     * order too. If a Stream throws an Exception, it is still guaranteed that
     * all Streams' close methods are called.
     *
     * <p>
     * Streams are processed one at at time. When one is exhausted, a new one
     * will start. Parallelism is only supported within the individual streams
     * provided.
     * <p>
     * N.B. a stream's close method may be called even through that stream never
     * produced any output, if a preceding stream threw an Exception.
     * <p>
     * N.B. an UnsupportedOperationException will be thrown if the concatenated
     * stream's {@link Stream#iterator()
     * } or {@link Stream#spliterator() } methods are called, because they could
     * potentially violate the resulting Stream's AutoClose property.
     * <p>
     * N.B. Use caution when constructing streams from repeated concatenation.
